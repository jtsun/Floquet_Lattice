Here is the short discription of code developed related to
"Time Crystal" and "Periodic Time-Driven System". For full
description consult the note.

-Dispersion.py:
	calculate the band structure of square and honeycomb
	lattices.

-Floquet_Dispersion.py:
	calculate the quasi-energies associated with the
	Floquet effective Hamiltonian for an honey-comb
	(graphene) lattice for three time-intervals

-Floquet_Dispersion_edgeField.py:
	the same Floquet quasienergies are calculated when
	driven field is localized at the edge.
	
-Floquet_Dispersion_onsite.py:
	calculate quasienergies when one-site energies are
	oscillating. 

-Floquet_Dispersion_wPBC.py:
	calculate the quasienergies for a system with
	periodic boundary condition.
	
-plot_FL.py:
	it plots the result from Floquet dispersion codes.

-k_solution.cpp:
	This program calculate the square overlap of
	the eigenfunctions of two Kroning-Penny lattice
	in frames moving respect to each other. In othre
	words the eigenfunctions of one is expanded in terms
	of the other.

-graph.py:
	it plots the results generated by "k_solution.cpp".
